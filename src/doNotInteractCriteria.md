1. **No Negative Vibes**: If your primary goal is to spread negativity or hate, please scroll past. I'm here for constructive conversations and positive interactions!
2. **Anti-Drama**: If you thrive on drama or enjoy instigating conflicts, let’s not engage. I prefer to keep things chill and focused on our common interests.
3. **No Unsolicited Advice**: If you come with the intention of giving unsolicited advice about my coding practices, please reconsider. I appreciate constructive criticism, but I’m not looking for random tips from strangers.
4. **Gaming Dissonance**: If you believe that any video game genre is inherently better than others, we might not get along. I believe every genre has its merits, so let's keep the gaming discussions respectful!
5. **Tech Snobbery**: If you look down on people for using frameworks like Electron or Tauri, this isn't the place for you. I like to explore different tools and techniques without elitism.
6. **No Arch Linux Elitists**: If you’re an Arch Linux elitist who believes that using anything other than Arch is inferior, we won’t see eye to eye. I’m here to enjoy tech in all its forms!
7. **Inflexibility in Learning**: If you can’t handle someone learning at their own pace or experimenting with new ideas, it’s best we don’t interact. Everyone’s journey is unique!
8. **Overly Political**: If your posts are overwhelmingly political without a balance of humor or positivity, I might avoid engaging. I prefer light-hearted conversations or focused discussions that don’t dive too deep into divisive topics.
9. **No Spam or Bots**: If you’re a bot or just here to spam links, I’ll kindly pass. Genuine interaction is what I’m after!
10. **Cliché Memes**: If your humor relies solely on tired memes or clichés, I may not find our interaction enjoyable. I appreciate creativity and originality!
11. **Shipping Disagreement**: If you ship Match and Pencil from BFDI with anyone other than each other, we’re not on the same page. They belong together, and any other pairing just isn’t right!
12. **Proship/Related**: If you identify as proship or have any beliefs related to it that promote harmful or inappropriate relationships, please don’t interact. I prioritize healthy discussions and boundaries in fandom.
13. **Drama Llamas**: If you thrive on drama and are a “drama llama,” I suggest we keep our distance. I prefer interactions that bring joy rather than chaos.
14. **Respectful Communication**: I reserve the right not to respond to emails or messages that do not respect this criteria. Let’s keep our interactions positive and respectful!
15. **Email Organization**: Please put the message you want to send me in the "Social" category in Gmail. This way, I can easily find important messages like 2FA codes without them getting buried in questions or other topics.
16. **Patience Requested**: I only check my email every once in a while, so please be patient if I don’t respond immediately. I appreciate your understanding!
